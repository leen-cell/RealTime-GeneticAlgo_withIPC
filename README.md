# Rescue Robots Path Planning using Genetic Algorithms  
**Real-Time Systems – Project 2**

##  Project Overview
This project implements a **real-time rescue robot coordination system** using a **Genetic Algorithm (GA)** for path planning and exploration in a **3D grid environment**.  
Multiple robots operate simultaneously to explore unknown areas, rescue targets, and avoid collisions while optimizing their movement paths.

The system integrates:
- Genetic Algorithms for optimization  
- Multi-processing and multi-threading concepts  
- Inter-process communication (IPC)  
- Real-time constraints  
- Optional 3D visualization using OpenGL  

The goal is to demonstrate how intelligent optimization techniques can be combined with real-time systems principles to solve complex coordination problems.

##  Objectives
- Design a **genetic algorithm** for robot path optimization
- Simulate **multiple robots working in parallel**
- Handle **shared data safely** using IPC mechanisms
- Optimize exploration coverage and rescue efficiency
- Detect and minimize **collisions between robots**
- Provide a **visual and textual analysis** of robot paths

---

##  System Architecture
- **Parent Process**
  - Runs the Genetic Algorithm
  - Generates populations and selects elite solutions
  - Assigns best chromosomes to robots
- **Child Processes (Robots)**
  - Execute paths generated by GA
  - Explore the map independently
  - Compute fitness values
  - Report results back to the parent
- **Optional Threads**
  - Used for internal robot tasks (movement, evaluation)

Communication is achieved using:
- Shared Memory
- Semaphores

##  Genetic Algorithm Design
Each **Chromosome** represents:
- A robot path (sequence of moves)
- A starting position
- Fitness value
- Path length

### Genetic Operators
- **Selection**: Tournament / tolerant selection
- **Crossover**: Combines parent paths
- **Mutation**: Random move alteration
- **Injection**: Random individuals added to preserve diversity
- **Elitism**: Best solutions are preserved each generation

### Fitness Function Considers:
- Number of explored cells
- Rescue targets reached
- Path efficiency
- Collision penalties
- Redundant movement penalties

---

##  Map and Environment
- 3D grid-based map loaded from text files
- Cells may represent:
  - Free space
  - Obstacles
  - Rescue targets
- Robots start from predefined or random locations

---

##  Visualization 
A 3D OpenGL visualization is included to:
- Display robot paths
- Animate movement step-by-step
- Show collisions and overlaps
- Compare paths of multiple robots simultaneously

Controls include:
- Mouse rotation and zoom
- Keyboard navigation
- Animation control
